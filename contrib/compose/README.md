# Docker Compose Quickstart

This is an example of how to run a GRS node, GRS c-lightning node and Spark wallet

### Configuration & Running

Ensure you have docker & docker-compose installed, edit the `.env` options to your liking  and run `docker-compose up`. By default it will run mainnet and spark wallet will be available at `localhost:9876` (after GRS syncs)
